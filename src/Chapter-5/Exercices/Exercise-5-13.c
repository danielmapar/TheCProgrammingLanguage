 Description : Write the program tail, which prints the last n lines of its
               input. By default, n is set to 10, let us say, but it can be
               changed by an optional argument so that tail -n prints the last
               n lines. The program should behave rationally no matter how
               unreasonable the input or the value of n. Write the program
               so it makes the best use of available storage; lines should be
               stored as in the sorting program of Section 5.6, not in a
               two-dimensional array of fixed size.
