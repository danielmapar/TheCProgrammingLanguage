 Description : Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and
               exercises with pointers instead of array indexing. Good
               possibilities include getline (Chapters 1 and 4), atoi, itoa,
               and their variants (Chapters 2, 3, and 4), reverse (Chapter 3),
               and strindex and getop (Chapter 4).
